How is a webpage loaded(step by step)?

1. You type http://127.0.0.1:3000/home/index.html
2. You send a request to the server listening on 127.0.0.1 port 3000.
3. This request contains the GET /home/index.html in it, as well as other information.
4. The server parses the request and sends the response.
5. The response is parsed by the browser, and then interpreted.
6. The client generates a document object model.
7. The resources are loaded one by one.
8. The stylesheets are parsed.
9. The javascript is parsed.

The question is now, how is stylesheet and javascript parsed? eg head vs body javascript.
